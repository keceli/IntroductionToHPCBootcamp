        "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **NOTE:** *The tutorial content in this notebook are from LangChain tutorials. However, the implementation of the RAG pipeline in this notebook is not from LangChain, but follows a similar approach.*\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag/).\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain offers a multi-part tutorial:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Part 1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/) (similar to this guide) introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\n",
        "- [Part 2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\n",
        "over a text data source. If you're already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\n",
        "this [high-level overview of different retrieval techniques](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/retrieval/).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing [question/answering over SQL data](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: the indexing portion of this tutorial will largely follow the [semantic search tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/retrievers).\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Indexing\n",
        "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/document_loaders).\n",
        "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
        "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a [VectorStore](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores) and [Embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/embedding_models) model.\n",
        "\n",
        "![index_diagram](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/static/img/rag_indexing.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retrieval and generation\n",
        "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/retrievers).\n",
        "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/concepts/text_llms) produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\n",
        "\n",
        "![retrieval_diagram](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/static/img/rag_retrieval_generation.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we've indexed our data, we will use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) as our orchestration framework to implement the retrieval and generation steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
